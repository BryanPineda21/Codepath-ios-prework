## App Idea

Recycle Smart App:

This is an app that will allow users to find different ways to recycle their waste or donate useful items. This app will not only lead to environmental impact but it will also help the earth become more sustainable. In this app, users will be able to create an account and find different ways to recycle their waste or donate their items to those in need. Users will be able to earn points by inputting the items they have recycled or donated throughout the week. Finally, this app will consist of using Apiâ€™s and other technologies. 

## Notes

Although I did not face many challenges, It was fun playing around with the storyboard in Xcode and learning how I can use storyboard as a template for future apps.
